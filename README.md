# Redditer

- AS IDE version 3.6.3.
- Also tried out AS 4.0 Preview, almost killed the entire project - encoding got messed up, recovered from that :)
- MVVM architecture used
- Koin for DI, GSON for JSON parsing, Picasso for image loading
- Spent some time learning MotionLayout and implementing it in this project. Animations are not perfect, far from it, but i think it turned out nice :) This is what the majority of the time was spent on - i wanted to learn something new while doing this project.
